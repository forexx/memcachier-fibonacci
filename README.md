MemCachier Fibonacci Example
=====

This is an example Java Jetty app that uses MemCachier to cache Fibonacci digits in Heroku.

You can view a working version of this app at [memcachier-fibonacci.herokuapp.com](http://memcachier-fibonacci.herokuapp.com).  Running this app on your local machine in
development will work as well, although you'll need to install a local memcached server.  MemCachier is currently
only available in Heroku.
